# Backend - FastAPI with PostgreSQL

This directory contains the backend of the application built with FastAPI and a PostgreSQL database.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Poetry (for dependency management)
- PostgreSQL (ensure the database server is running)

### Installing Poetry

To install Poetry, follow these steps:

```sh
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

Add Poetry to your PATH (if not automatically added):

## Setup Instructions

1. **Navigate to the backend directory**:
    ```sh
    cd backend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies using Poetry**:
    ```sh
    poetry install
    ```

3. **Set up the database with the necessary tables**:
    ```sh
    poetry run bash ./prestart.sh
    ```

4. **Run the backend server**:
    ```sh
    poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```

5. **Update configuration**:
   Ensure you update the necessary configurations in the `.env` file, particularly the database configuration.

## to run the backend server on ec2

poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0

then use <ip address:8000> to access it


# PostgreSQL Installation & Troubleshooting Guide (macOS)

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on installing, setting up, and troubleshooting PostgreSQL on macOS.

---

## **1️⃣ Installing PostgreSQL on macOS**
### **Using Homebrew (Recommended)**
To install PostgreSQL version 14 using Homebrew, run:
```bash
brew install postgresql@14
```
After installation, start PostgreSQL as a service:
```bash
brew services start postgresql@14
```

### **Verify Installation**
Check if PostgreSQL is running:
```bash
pg_isready
```
If you see `accepting connections`, PostgreSQL is running.

List installed services:
```bash
brew services list
```

---

## **2️⃣ Connecting to PostgreSQL**
### **Enter the `psql` Shell**
By default, PostgreSQL creates a role matching your macOS username. Try:
```bash
psql -U $(whoami)
```
To explicitly connect as `postgres`:
```bash
psql -U postgres
```
To connect to a specific database:
```bash
psql -U postgres -d mydatabase
```

### **Exit the `psql` Shell**
To exit PostgreSQL, type:
```sql
\q
```

---

## **3️⃣ Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **❌ Error: "connection to server on socket '/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432' failed"**
#### ✅ **Check if PostgreSQL is Running**
```bash
brew services list
```
If PostgreSQL is not running, start it:
```bash
brew services start postgresql@14
```
Manually start PostgreSQL:
```bash
pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start
```
Verify if it's ready:
```bash
pg_isready
```

---

### **❌ Error: "FATAL: role 'postgres' does not exist"**
#### ✅ **Check Available Users**
```bash
psql -U $(whoami) -d postgres -c "\du"
```
If `postgres` is missing, create it:
```bash
createuser -U $(whoami) -s postgres
```
Or in `psql`:
```sql
CREATE ROLE postgres WITH SUPERUSER LOGIN PASSWORD 'your_secure_password';
```

---

### **❌ Error: "FATAL: database '<your_username>' does not exist"**
#### ✅ **Create a Database for Your User**
PostgreSQL tries to connect to a database matching your macOS username. If it doesn't exist, create it:
```bash
psql -U postgres -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE $(whoami);"
```
Now, try connecting again:
```bash
psql -U $(whoami) -d $(whoami)
```

---

### **❌ PostgreSQL Not Initialized**
If PostgreSQL wasn’t initialized properly, initialize it manually:
```bash
initdb /usr/local/var/postgres
```
Then restart the service:
```bash
brew services restart postgresql@14
```

---

## **4️⃣ List Users and Databases**
### **List All Users (Roles)**
Once inside the `psql` shell, run:
```sql
\du
```
Or use an SQL query:
```sql
SELECT rolname, rolsuper, rolcreatedb, rolcanlogin FROM pg_roles;
```

### **List All Databases**
```sql
\l
```
Or:
```sql
SELECT datname FROM pg_database;
```

---

## **5️⃣ Uninstalling PostgreSQL**
If you need to uninstall PostgreSQL, run:
```bash
brew uninstall postgresql@14
```
To remove all PostgreSQL data:
```bash
rm -rf /usr/local/var/postgres
```

Here's a documentation snippet you can add to your `README.md` for changing or creating a PostgreSQL user password on your Mac:

## Changing or Creating a PostgreSQL User Password on Mac

Follow these steps to change or create a password for a PostgreSQL user on your Mac.

### Prerequisites:
- PostgreSQL 14 is installed and running on your Mac.
- You have access to the terminal.

### Steps:

1. **Access PostgreSQL shell**  
   Open the terminal and log in to PostgreSQL as the `postgres` superuser:
   ```bash
   psql -U postgres
   ```
   This will prompt you for the password (if configured).

2. **Change the password for an existing user**  
   To change the password for an existing user, run the following SQL command inside the `psql` shell:
   ```sql
   ALTER USER <username> WITH PASSWORD '<newpassword>';
   ```
   Replace `<username>` with the PostgreSQL username and `<newpassword>` with the desired password.

3. **Create a new user with a password**  
   To create a new user and set a password, use the following command:
   ```sql
   CREATE USER <newusername> WITH PASSWORD '<newpassword>';
   ```
   Replace `<newusername>` with the desired username and `<newpassword>` with the password for that user.

4. **Exit PostgreSQL**  
   Once the password has been updated or the new user is created, exit the `psql` shell:
   ```sql
   \q
   ```

### Example:

To change the password for a user named `testuser` to `newpassword`, run:
```sql
ALTER USER testuser WITH PASSWORD 'newpassword';
```

To create a new user named `newuser` with password `mypassword`, run:
```sql
CREATE USER newuser WITH PASSWORD 'mypassword';
```
